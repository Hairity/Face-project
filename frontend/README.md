Fun APP where you can use API to recognize faces on pictures. It has database and ranks how many pictures have you tested. On of my biggest projects yet to date. 
Frontend - I use particles npm, background color APP that I made to choose gradiant background, tachyons for forms and easier style, different buttons, styles and backgrounds. It's fun to look at and play around.
